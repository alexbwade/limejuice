# "LimeJuice" wrapper

for Lime Light CRM (https://www.limelightcrm.com/)

(I made this a long time ago for Fitera's dynamic front-end sales pages; it aids in the creation of forms, tracking, and integration with LimeLight's API to submit orders. There are a many things wrong with it, but it worked pretty well for our purposes at the time - legacy environment with LAMP/jQuery.)
